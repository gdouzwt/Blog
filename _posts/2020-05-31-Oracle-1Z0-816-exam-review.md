Today, I dedicate myself to write this review, hopefully get it done before I go to bed.
I started with OCA Java SE 8 programmer I exam last year, it took me 12 days to prepared the OCA exam.
It was relatively easy to pass the OCA exam, but it was much harder to pass the OCP 11 exam. It took me  
roughly 3 months to get fully prepared for the ultimate 1Z0-816, namely Java SE 11 Programmer II exam,  
for which response to the Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 11 Developer certification.
This is by far the most difficult Java certification exam from Oracle/Sun, not just because it covers topics
such as modules, functional programming, concurrent programming, IO. But also it includes some new objectives,  
like Java Secure Coding Guideline.  
For those who plan on to take the Oracle Java Certification exam, I strongly recommend you to take a look the
official exam objectives before you start your study plan. Buy a good book, I think Selikoff's book is great,
I use that book for my exam preparation. Study the book chapter by chapter, or by topic, or whatever you want.
Be sure to do the exercises, it will help you to consolidate your knowledge. It also helpful to use flashcard  
to aid the memorization process. Say some core APIs, or some syntax rules.  
Don't go directly into the quiz without studying the materials thoroughly, that will just a waste of time and energy.
Because that's very frustrated to see lots of errors.  Take your time, start slowly, and gradually level up the difficulty.  

now let's break down the exam objectives by sections:  

Oracle 的 Secure Coding Guidelines for Java SE 页面已经更新了，排版比较现代了，而且小标题改为Updated for Java SE 11 而不是 Java SE 13

While questions within a topic were relatively straight-forward, the amount of topics you had to know for the 1Z0-816 exam dwarfs the 1Z0-809 exam. Annotations, Security, Local Type Inference, Private/Static Interface Methods, and Modules are completely new.
