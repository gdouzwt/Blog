The notation  x = ln y  is a shorthand for the *natural logarithm* to the base e:  x = loge y . This notation is used throughout mathematics, science, and engineering.

The shorthand notation  x = log y  is sometimes used when the base  b  remains fixed and is understood from the context. The "understood" base, however, can vary from place to place:

  - x = log y  often means  x = loge y  in **mathematics** texts.

  - x = log y  often means  x = log10 y  in **science and engineering** texts.

  - x = log y  often means  x = log2 y  in **computer science** texts.
  
Be careful when reading or using  x = log y .
